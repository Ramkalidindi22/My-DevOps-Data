1. Sorting Strings Create a list of strings. Sort them alphabetically. Sort them by length. Sort them by length in descending order. Advanced: Sort by length, then sort equal length strings alphabetically

def words = ["Red","Blue","Green","Yellow","Orange"]
words=words.sort()
println words
words = words.sort { it.size() }
println words
words = words.sort { -it.size() }
println words

o/p:
[Blue, Green, Orange, Red, Yellow]
[Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow]
[Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red]
