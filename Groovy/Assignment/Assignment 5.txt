5. Prime Numbers Write a method called isPrime that takes an integer argument and returns a boolean. Determine whether the number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 up to one less than the number. That limit is too high, of course. How high do you have to check to be sure whether you've gone far enough?

def Prime(num) {
    i=2
    count=0
    while(i<num) {
        if (num%i==0) {
            count=count+1
            if (count==1) {
                return false
            }
        }
        i=i+1
    }
    return true
 }

 print "enter the num: "
 num=System.console().readLine()
 number=n um as Integer
 result=Prime(number)
 if (result) {
     println "yes $num prime number"
 }
 else {
println "$num is not a prime number"
}

o/p:
enter the num: 2
yes 2 prime number

enter the num: 10
10 is not a primenumber
